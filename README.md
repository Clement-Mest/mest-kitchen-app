# MEST KITCHEN APP: FRONTEND


## Getting Started

The MEST Kitchen App now has its own Slack channel for all communications.

We're to join the channel where all app announcements will be made, as covered in class today.

To access the channel, use this link
(https://join.slack.com/t/mestkitchenapp/shared_invite/zt-18h5v1zjq-b1tD4HIa3GbHWoHOkRZ8hw) and your meltwater email address (@meltwater.org) as your primary address.

About the Channel
There are 4 communication channels. Help, General, Guidelines and Team Lead

1. #general: This will be the primary channel for all app-related announcements. 

2. #help: This channel will be used exclusively for app-related queries and help.

3. #guidelines: The project's guidelines and instructions will be posted here to help us understand what we need to do at each stage.

4. #team-leads: All team leads will join this channel for meetings and discussions

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks 
Team 1
